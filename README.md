# About Me

I am an experienced Geography graduate specialized in Geospatial Analysis with over two years experience as a Research
Assistant, focusing on climate change impact on cash crops in California. I am highly proficient in GIS and Python coding for data
analysis and automation.

## Description

This page provides the python codes that I have created for various projects and coursework during my tenure at California Polytechnic 
University, Pomona. The majority of the codes provided are in relation with my research on the impact of climate change on Pistachio 
crops in California. These codes involve the creation of Global Climate Model (GCM) databases, which atrributes to terabytes of information.
I have also provided the Maximum Entropy and Random Forest Classification prediction models which were created to understand how the 
suitability range of pistachios will be changing in the near future.
